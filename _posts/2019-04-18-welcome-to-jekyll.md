# Research:

This is a partner project that I am working on with Daniel Lokas. We are working with the Pearl Rehabilitation Center at Atrium Health, here in Charlotte, to create a variety of assistive devices needed for the patients. The first one Daniel and I are working on is a robotic cup holder that will bring drinks close to the patients, so patients with limited mobility can easily take a drink of water without needing to ask their nurses. We are calling it the Adaptive Arm-Based Beverage Delivery System (AABBDS). The project will use the design from my robotic arm from my electrical engineering capstone as a base, and we will edit the code and hardware to be fit for the task at hand. 

__Attribution of Projects:__

The original project comes from the website "How to Mechatronics". Our project will remove the claw-like gripping device and replaces it with a cup holder. We use strong 20kg servos rather than 14kg servos so the arm can withstand the weight of heavy cups of beverages. We also plan to use a remote control rather than an app to control the arm while also giving the arm 3 preset conditions to streamline the usabilty, naking it easier for anyone to understand the controls. Lastly, we plan to remove the original base to replace it with a mount that easily mounts to a wheelchair.

# Daily Journal

9/26: We visited the Pearl Rehab center, and had the chance to sit in on appointments, see the kind of people who need this project, and ask specific questions on how our projects would work. 

9/25: Started with a practice soldering board and soldered 3 resistors. I then began working on the actual owl soldering board 

9/29: Continued with the owl soldering board 

9/30: Finished soldering all components on the board, but it did not light up. 

10/1: Absent in class 

10/6: Finished soldering my board, fixing the solder bridges

10/7:  I researched designs for the cup holder section of the arm, like making the cup holder magnetic or using an unspillable cup holder so that bumps or rapid movement would not lead to the cup spilling. I used Flint AI to give me ideas on how to have cup designs

10/9: Daniel and I visited my previous project to see what parts should be modified to accommodate the needs of this project. We will change the base to a mount that can be mounted on wheelchairs. We sketched out our design in Notability to think about how cadding would work

10/10: Daniel and I thought of questions to email the Pearl group about and what we would need to see at the next meeting

10/14-24: We worked on setting up a digital portfolio in GitHub with Mr. Dubick.

10/27-31: We were introduced to a CAM soffware called: MakeraCam. We learned how to take PCB disign files and mill them out on our PCB Machines. We continued to learn how to use the software while also writing a workflow, which is shown in the PCB documention post.

11/3: I worked with daniel to disuss what parts of the project needed to be edited. 

11/4: I millted my PCB board with raaj. 

11/6-11: I spent researching a holding device for the cup that would significantly reduce the amount of spills during sudent movements

11/12: I found a cup design that would work and we then printed it and tested it with a paper cup filled with water. The test was successfull so we had our starting design that we could work with

11/13-14: In class we worked on locating our mountain ranges for our topography maps and then made CRV files for them on the Bamboo studio software.

11/17-11/19: absent because ill

11/20: Began to learn how ot use Aspire to create a CNC file to mill my topography map.

11/21-11/30: break

12/1-5: We worked with electronics on TinkerCad

12/9: I drafted an email to send to the pearl team to schedule our next visit to the rehab center. We plan to go with the other class first period next week. 

12/10: We had dates confused so we had to schedule a seperate visit, not wiht the other class. I then finished the email and sent it out. I began to add to the original giro-cup design in fusion360

12/11: I continued designing a bottom to our giro cup holder. 

12/12: I completee the first prototype that we could show the Physical therapists at the pearl.

12/15: Today we printed the prototype design. I also had to continue using aspire for to create my CNC file. We also agreed to visit the Rehab center on Thurday 12/18.  

12/16: The file failed because the nosel on the printer go jammed. We then print the file again. I finished makeding my CNC file on aspire and then I milled my topography map

12/17: the file again did not print, this time it was because the bed was not alligned properly so in kept knocking into the display off centering the print more and more. The print was already thrown out by the time we saw the printer, so there are no photos. We printed it again.

12/18: Today we were supposed to visit the Carolinas Rehab Center, however I had the flu so we had to postpone the trip to another day. 

# Challanges: 

The main challenges that I have faced are with 3D printing my prototype. Oringnally my print failed becuase the nosel on the printer was clogged. When I reprinted it on a different printer, the bed was not placed on correctly so it kept hitting against the display. The print was stopped by a teacher and thrown out before I was able to see thought.
